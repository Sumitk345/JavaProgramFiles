Today's Session Main points:
In Java, all features, attributes, methods, etc. are linked to classes and objects. We cannot write a Java program just with the main function without declaring a class the way we can do in C++.
An object is an entity that has a state and exhibits behavior.
Constructors are special methods that are generally used to initialize an instance of a class. Constructors do not have a return type, they have the same name as the class, and may or may not contain parameters.
Java provides a class named “Class” which keeps all the information about classes and objects in the system. We can use the forName () method of the ‘Class’ class to create an object.
Object class in Java provides a clone () method that returns the clone or copy of the object passed as an argument to the clone () method.
Java provides a technique called deserialization wherein we read an object from a saved file. 
A class is a template used for the creation of objects. An object is an instance of a class. While a class is a logical entity, an object is a physical entity. Each object has a state in which all the member variables have specific values. The class does not have a state.
The Object is created using new, forName ().newInstance () , clone() methods.
A class can have any number of instances or objects.
Every object has a copy of member fields and their associated values.
